# Student Resource Management System

<br>

### Summary

<p align="justify">
  This is my first backend-based project where PHP and MySQL are used to develop the application. Under the guided projects of Crio.do, this project was developed. A Student Resource Management System where a student can check his result and save it to pdf. The database is set up on MySQL using the Apache XAMPP server, and the communication is done through PHP. An admin login page is designed where the admin can make all the CRUD operations to the database through the frontend rather than performing them through the server. The relational database schema is illustrated below.
