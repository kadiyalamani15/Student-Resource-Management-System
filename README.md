# Student Resource Management System

<br>

### Summary

<p align="justify">
  This is my first backend based project where PHP and MySQL are used to develop the application. Under the guided projects of <a href="https://www.crio.do">Crio.do</a>, this project was developed. A Student Resource Management System where a student can check his result and save it to pdf. The database is setup on MySQL using Apache XAMPP server and the communication is done through PHP. An admin login page is designed where admin can make all the CRUD operations to the database through frontend rather than performing them through the server. The database design is illustrated below.
